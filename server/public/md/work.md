* Desc: This was my first professional job. I was responsible for the development of an e-commerce platform built totally from scratch, so I got to work on all the aspects - the front-end, back-end, databases (pretty large ones, considering I had to import a lot of products from wholesalers and keep the website running smooth for clients as well), eventually even adding a custom synchronization system with MS Dynamics AX. Additionally, I was responsible for all the server management, so system administration tasks were among my responsibilities as well. While it was hard and I made a lot of mistakes in the process, I really learned a lot about the web development and programming in general from all sides, about the database configuration and performance, server configuration, and all the other related aspects. I also learned a lot about source code management and version control systems, and closely and efficiently working in a team with a designer. Invaluable experience.
